# C4 Modding Compendium
## Info
The start of a community-driven guide to modding.

## Status 
Currently this is a fairly baren guide, but in the future it is hoped to have
multiple tutorials and a full lua/ini api dump with type info and descriptions.

## Contributing
Please use asciidoctor formatting for guides, the ini and lua api are a json
database of things. Eventually these will be generated into adoc as well or
some other site generator thing.
