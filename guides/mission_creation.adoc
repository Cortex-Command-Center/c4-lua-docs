== What is a scene
Making a map in cortex command is pretty simple though can be time consuming.
There are three levels of scene you can make:
Terrain::
    Just a simple terrain, no debris, no structures. This is the first phase of making a map.
Scene::
    Terrain with debris, rocks, decorations, and maybe structures.
Activity::
    A fully-scripted mission taking place on the terrain.
